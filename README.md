# RNA-Seq Differential Expression Pipeline

This repository provides a simple pipeline for RNA-Seq data analysis using Python and R.  
It demonstrates how to download datasets from GEO, perform differential expression analysis using DESeq2, and visualize results with volcano plots and heatmaps.

## Features
- Automatic GEO dataset download
- Differential expression with DESeq2
- Visualization of top genes

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- R with DESeq2, ggplot2, pheatmap

## How to Run
1. Run `download_data.py` to fetch dataset.
2. Run `differential_expression.R` for analysis.
3. Run `visualization.R` to generate plots.
